 Problem Statement:
------------------------------
    AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
    Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, 
    AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
    As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. 
    However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights
